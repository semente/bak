# bak --- simple, efficient, and encrypted backups

The purpose of **bak** is to be a simple, secure, easy to set up, and
use backup solution for GNU/Linux.

Although not tested on BSDs, Mac OS X, cygnus and the like, it should
work fine in any machine with *GNU coreutils, bash, rsync and GnuPG*
-- feel free to send pull requests to increase compatibility and ease
of deploy in systems other than GNU/Linux.

It is also required that you have a PGP key configured **and know how
to handle GnuPG**.

The initial version of this tool was written in less than a hour and I
would keep it simple. I do not intend to add more features or let the
code bloated, but any good idea is very welcome. Use the link
https://github.com/semente/bak/issues to suggest any changes.
